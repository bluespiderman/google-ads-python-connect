I have got lists of urls. And I will input some keywords. And then I want to get the generated search keywords based on them.
There are several libraries and tools available that can help you generate search keywords based on a list of URLs and input keywords. One popular library for working with natural language processing (NLP) tasks in Python is NLTK. It has a built-in function called nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize() which will tokenize a given sentence into individual words. You can use this function to tokenize the text from each URL and then perform various NLP techniques such as stemming or lemmatization to generate keywords.

Another tool you can use is Gensim which is a python library for topic modeling, document indexing and similarity retrieval. With gensim, you can perform topic modeling on your list of urls and based on that you can generate keywords.

You can use python’s beautifulsoup package to parse the HTML code of each URL and extract text from the page. Then you can use the above mentioned libraries to tokenize, stem and generate keywords.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further question.

No, I mean the generated keywords are based on the contents of given urls.
If you want to generate keywords based on the contents of a given list of URLs, one approach you can take is to use web scraping to extract the text from each page, and then use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant keywords.

One library you can use for web scraping in Python is Beautiful Soup. It allows you to parse HTML or XML documents and extract specific elements. After you have extracted the text from the pages, you can use techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging to identify important keywords in the text.

Another approach you can use is tf-idf (term frequency–inverse document frequency) which is a method to extract keywords that occur frequently in a given text but not in the entire text collection. It is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. This method can help you identify keywords that are relevant to the content of a specific page and differentiate them from common words that appear on many pages.

You can combine these above approach and in the end, you will have list of keywords for the urls.
Let me know if there's anything more you need to know.

Is there apis for that?
Yes, there are a number of APIs available that can help you extract keywords from a given URL or a text.

A popular one is the Google Cloud Natural Language API, which provides advanced natural language processing capabilities, such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and syntax analysis. You can use the API to extract entities (people, places, things) and extract important keywords from the text.

Another option is the Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API, which provides a wide range of NLP capabilities, including key phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and language detection. You can use the API to extract the important keywords and phrases from a given text.

Aylien is another popular NLP API service which can be used for text analysis, sentiment analysis, summarization, classification, concept tagging and entity extraction, it provides several endpoints like extracting keywords, summary, classify and classify by taxonomy which can be used in this case.

You can also use the IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding, which can be used for extract entities, keywords, concepts, sentiment, emotions and relations from text.

These are just a few examples, there are other APIs available as well, each of which offers different features and capabilities. It's best to check the documentation and pricing of each service to see which one will best meet your needs.

Please let me know if you need more information on the use of these apis or the process of integrating with them.

Howa about using semrush?
Yes, you can use SEMrush, which is a popular keyword research tool, to extract keywords from a given URL. SEMrush can provide you with a variety of information about keywords, including their search volume, CPC, and competition.

SEMrush has a feature called "Keyword Overview" which you can use to find keywords related to a given website or URL. You just need to provide the URL of the website and SEMrush will show you the keywords that website is ranking for and also give you an idea of the other keywords that website should target to increase their visibility.

You can also use the SEMrush Keyword Magic Tool to find new keywords and group them into relevant themes, and also use Keyword Difficulty tool to check the difficulty level of a specific keyword, it also suggest you similar keywords which you can use as well.

Additionally, SEMrush also has a feature called "On-Page SEO Checker" that allows you to analyze the on-page SEO of a website and get keyword recommendations for a given webpage.

SEMrush is a powerful tool for keyword research, it does have a paid version but you can use its free version for a limited time period and for limited results as well.

It is important to note that SEMrush is not a pure API service, but rather a web-based tool with API access, you would need to sign up for a SEMrush account and generate API Key to be able to use its API.

And then, how about Google Cloud Natural Language API?
The Google Cloud Natural Language API is a cloud-based natural language processing service provided by Google Cloud. With this API, you can extract insights from unstructured text by using pre-trained machine learning models.

You can use the Google Cloud Natural Language API to extract keywords from a given text or URL by sending a request to the API with the text or URL as the input, and the API will return the keywords it has extracted in the response. The returned keywords will be in the form of a list of entities, each of which contains information such as the text of the entity, the entity type (person, location, organization, etc.), and a salience score, which indicates the importance or relevance of the entity in the text.

You can also use other features of the Natural Language API like sentiment analysis and entities detection to get more insights about your text or url.

You would need to create a project on the Google Cloud Console and enable the Google Cloud Natural Language API for that project, and then generate a service account key to authenticate with the API and make requests.

It's important to keep in mind that the usage of this service will be subject to Google Cloud Platform pricing, depending on usage and the type of resources you are using.
